                    <h3>People that inspire me</h3>
                    
                    <p>From engineers to Susan Boyle, a collection of people that inspire me.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Engineers and Researchers</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Ben Bolte</strong> is the founder of K-Scale Labs, he is also the deisgn inspiration behind my website. I think it is pretty cool how he set out to try and bring commerical humanoid robotics to the public without costing an arm and leg. Ultimately, he had to shutter K-Scale but even then not many would have ventured to attempt what he envisioned.</p>

                    <p><strong>Basically Homeless</strong> while a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BasicallyHomeless" target="_blank">light hearted channel</a> that takes on engineering challenges for fun and content, I think being able to bring an idea to life is a skill worth having.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Beyond Engineering</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Susan Boyle</strong>, Her Britain's Got Talent audition in 2009 was a powerful reminder to never judge a book by its cover. Her story shows that talent and determination can overcome any preconceptions, and that it's never too late to pursue your dreams.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Why They Matter</h4>
                    
                    <p>These individuals inspire me not just because of their achievements, but because of their approach to life. They're willing to take risks and persist through setbacks. They share their knowledge openly and inspire others to push boundaries.</p>
                    
                    <p>That mindset is what drives innovation and what I aspire to bring to my own work.</p>
