                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    
                    <p>Hi, I'm a software engineer that has a passion for robotics, autonomous systems, aerospace, and AI.</p>
                    
                    <p class="inline-links">

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I currently work as a software engineer at <span class="company-highlight">NVIDIA</span>, where I lead the technical development of my team's internal data platform. 
                        My work consists of system design, computational data analysis automation, leveraging distributed computing technologies, and optimizing systems for performance and scalability.</p>

                    <p>During my time at NVIDIA, I also contributed to the Isaac Sim (Robotics Simulation Platform) project. I helped create unit tests for the ROS2 framework in Isaac Sim and also worked on other tasks related to ROS2 within the project. 
                        I am particularly interested in perception and prediction in regards to robotics, autonomous systems, and aerospace; it is fascinating how through a little hard work we can give machines the ability to see, predict, and act. 
                        Take a look at some of my projects to see me implement various aspects of robotics including motion planning, path finding algorithms, multi-agent coordination, and machine learning applications in dynamic environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>I recived my <span class="company-highlight">Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz</span> (UCSC) in 2024 where my focus was in Game AI. Throughout my time at UCSC, I was involed in various labs apart of Baskin School of Engineering, there I was able to become a contributor to a paper submitted to CHI'23. 
                        Currently, I am pursuing my <span class="company-highlight">Masters in Robotics and Automation at Santa Clara University</span>. I hope that this will be a helpful stepping stone into getting my PhD</p>
